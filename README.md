### Few days ago, I discovered the Filamentalist  rewinder

Then I decided to print the first prototype and made some changes, after that, I discovered the latest version of Filamentalist rewinder, then I will come back soon with new modifications!

### Modifications has been done on following elements:

- Modified back roller, now has been made as a single part, ussing supports at printing time, I need to have a look to the new ones (V3), in order to adopt the new ones or continue with those rebuilt old ones,
  I made the change to a single part, because the two threaded halves, doesn't rotate too aligned, at least in my prototipe.
- Changed commercial rubber bands by a TPU 3D printed one, with some lines to deliver better grip and improved reel driving.
- Changes on front Rim rollers, because of the use of the new rubber band, I made a modification, converting the old rim in two halves, with a centering ring inside,
  and four heat inserts, mounted from the opposite face as the screws face, using four units of M3x15 screws,
  to have single segure, well centered part, in next days I will make some changes, in order to have the locking screw, to avoid movements relative to the axis.
- Changes in drive roller in order to avoid the use of O-Rings, again a specially designed TPU ring, has been mounted instead the two O-Rings, because of this modification, I did again,
  a two parts drive roller, it closes using 4 units of M2'5x8 screws, and 4 units of M2'5 heat inserted nuts, as I normally do, the nuts are mounteds in the opposite side of the screws side.
- Changes on filament input output part, because as on lots of DYI designs, there is a screw, working as an axle, with a big part of group of parts rotating around it,
  but scrapping the main part with the screw's thread, working as a metal file, then I introduced a piece of 4 mm OD brass pipe, in order to be used as a "bearing", holding inside the moving screw,
  and avoiding the plastic to be scrapped, this is easily understandable looking at the related pictures.
